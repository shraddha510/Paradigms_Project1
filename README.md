# Paradigms_Project1
CS 4337: Programming Language Paradigms Project 1

Files included:
- main.hs: Contains the Haskell code for the expression calculator.
- README.txt: This file.
- Writeup.pdf: Write-up document detailing the approach, organization, encountered problems, and learning outcomes.

How to compile and run the project:
1. Have GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the source code files.
4. Compile the Haskell code using the command: `ghc -o calculator expression_calculator.hs` or `ghc expression_calculator.hs`.
5. Run the compiled program using the command: `./calculator` or `./expression_calculator` (on Unix/Linux).

Notes:
- This program is designed to handle expressions written in prefix notation.
- Ensure expressions are correctly formatted and valid, otherwise errors may occur. My program runs with expressions that contain spaces between numbers, otherwise whitespace is insignificant.
- Use 'exit' to terminate the program.
